<p>This project will design and develop a web-based platform implementing a socio-technical solution to
a significant software engineering problem today: the lack of software specifications.Today society,
and the nation critically depend on software to manage critical infrastructures. However, we are not
yet able to consistently produce software that is both of highest quality and free of defects.
Specifications can help us achieve these benefits for high quality software. Specifications tell
humans and tools about intended behavior of a software system and make it possible to verify an
implementation's behavior. Useful, comprehensible, and efficiently checkable specifications are
critical for containing the cost of developing high assurance, reliable, and secure software systems.
Widespread availability of specifications can empower a wide variety of techniques for software
verification and lead to enormous productivity gains. This project will attack a significant hurdle in the
path of software specifications that commonly used libraries do not have good documentation and
specifications. As a result of that, if a software engineer using these libraries wants to write and verify
specifications for their own project they must first write specifications for these libraries, which might
threaten their resolve and budget. The project's goal is to create a web-platform where SE
community can come together to help create specifications for commonly used Java libraries. This
web-platform will be seeded by scraping information about classes and methods in these libraries
from existing sources such as grepcode.com and stackoverflow.com. The web-based platform will
also facilitate users to login and collectively write specifications much like stackoverflow users
collectively respond to technical questions. This data will be made available to SE tools via an API.</p>
