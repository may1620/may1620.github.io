{"name":"May1620.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"## Project Outline\r\nThis project will design and develop a web-based platform implementing a socio-technical solution to\r\na significant software engineering problem today: the lack of software specifications.Today society,\r\nand the nation critically depend on software to manage critical infrastructures. However, we are not\r\nyet able to consistently produce software that is both of highest quality and free of defects.\r\nSpecifications can help us achieve these benefits for high quality software. Specifications tell\r\nhumans and tools about intended behavior of a software system and make it possible to verify an\r\nimplementation's behavior. Useful, comprehensible, and efficiently checkable specifications are\r\ncritical for containing the cost of developing high assurance, reliable, and secure software systems.\r\nWidespread availability of specifications can empower a wide variety of techniques for software\r\nverification and lead to enormous productivity gains. This project will attack a significant hurdle in the\r\npath of software specifications that commonly used libraries do not have good documentation and\r\nspecifications. As a result of that, if a software engineer using these libraries wants to write and verify\r\nspecifications for their own project they must first write specifications for these libraries, which might\r\nthreaten their resolve and budget. The project's goal is to create a web-platform where SE\r\ncommunity can come together to help create specifications for commonly used Java libraries. This\r\nweb-platform will be seeded by scraping information about classes and methods in these libraries\r\nfrom existing sources such as grepcode.com and stackoverflow.com. The web-based platform will\r\nalso facilitate users to login and collectively write specifications much like stackoverflow users\r\ncollectively respond to technical questions. This data will be made available to SE tools via an API.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
